Here this is the folder where i am learning javascript from beginning onwards so that 
i can become a proficient in front end development. here i am learning pinch to pinch concept of the java script.
so lets get started :)
// here i am documenting the variables of the java script where i learnt about
var, let and const

var is used among all the java script code and before 2015 it is only one varible to 
be used

// let and const are introduced in 2015 ES6 where it has specific features
// let has block scope 
    let cannot be redeclared
    let should be declared before use

<!-- Here i learnt about operators in javascript -->
There are 8 types of operators in javascript
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment operators
3. Comparison operators
4. String operators
5. Bitwise operators
6. logical operators
7. ternary operators
8. type operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:
    1. addition
    2. subtraction
    3. multiplication
    4. division
    5. modulus
    6. exponential
    7. increment
    8. decrement

2. Assignment Operators:
    1. =
    2. +=
    3. -=
    4. *=
    5. /=
    6. %=
    7. **=
    There are additional 3 Assignment Operators in javascript
    1. Shift Assignment Operators
    2. Bitwise Assignment Operators
    3. logical Assignment operators

        Again These are still divided into 3 types
        Shift Assignment Operators
        1. left shift Assignment operators (<<=)
        2. right shift assignment operators (>>=)
        3. unassigned right shift operators (>>>=)

        Bitwise Assignment operators
        1. AND (&=)
        2. OR (|=)
        3. XOR (^=)

        Logical Assignment Operators
        1. logical AND (&&=)
        2. logical OR (||=)
        3. nullish coalescing Operator (??=)
