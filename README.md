Here this is the folder where i am learning javascript from beginning onwards so that 
i can become a proficient in front end development. here i am learning pinch to pinch concept of the java script.
so lets get started :)
// here i am documenting the variables of the java script where i learnt about
var, let and const

var is used among all the java script code and before 2015 it is only one varible to 
be used

// let and const are introduced in 2015 ES6 where it has specific features
// let has block scope 
    let cannot be redeclared
    let should be declared before use
